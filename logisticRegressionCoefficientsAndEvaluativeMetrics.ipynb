    "We saw that logistic regression is one way of modeling the probability data points belong to one of two classes.\n",
    "The model used a data transform---the logistic function.\n",
    "The logistic function transformed the an unbounded linear function $(\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X + \\cdots)$ onto the interval $[0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model looked like the following\n",
